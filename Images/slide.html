        <h2>What is our bootcamp</h2>
        <!-- Make every 'Front-End Web Development' sentence in the following article bold -->
        <p>Our <strong>Front-End Web Development</strong> Bootcamp is designed to kickstart your career as junior web developer or as an entrepreneur with a vision to build your own website, app or software solution.</p>
        <p>As a non-profit organization we have partnered with Flatiron School in New York, one of the leading coding schools in the world. That allows us to teach their <strong>Front-End Web Development</strong> course introducing you to HTML and CSS. We provide additional
            training on React, a library for building user interfaces maintained by Facebook and Instagram. And during our program, you will learn JavaScript, all of which will allow you to build amazing websites and accelerate your journey to becoming
            a working Web Developer! </p>
        <p>By the end of the program, you will have a portfolio of completed projects to highlight your achievements. </p>
        <p>The <strong>Front-End Web Development</strong> course will take approximately 3.5 months with 10 hours per week of in-person training and 15-25 hours per week of self-study. </p>
        <p>The last 1.5 month of the bootcamp will be dedicated to a final project to help you build your portfolio of work. </p>
        <p>Our programs are all in english.</p>
